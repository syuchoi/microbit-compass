It's a compass that I'm honestly not sure works very well.

Don't ask me about the LED notation. I struggle with it too.

## How to use
After powering on and finishing compass calibration, the arrow will show as an LED.

Press the A button to display the compass heading in degrees.

Press the B button to turn the LED off and on.

The A+B buttons are for quick glances at the arrow.

Pressing them will display the arrow for one second and then disappear.
